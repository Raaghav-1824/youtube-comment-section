# Comment Section Project

This project is a simple **Comment Section** built to explore and understand system design principles in a real-world scenario.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of **system design** concepts, particularly focusing on building a scalable, responsive, and user-friendly comment component. This project was undertaken to gain practical experience with data flow, state management, and rendering optimizations.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, which makes managing UI state and building reusable components straightforward.
- **Context API**: Utilized for efficient global state management, allowing seamless access to state data across components without prop drilling.
- **Prop-Types**: Used for prop validation to ensure type safety and aid in debugging during development.
- **CSS Modules**: Employed for modular styling, helping maintain clean, conflict-free CSS specific to each component.

## Key Learnings
- Designed an efficient comment system that supports dynamic content updates and interactions.
- Gained practical knowledge of front-end system design trade-offs, including state management and UI responsiveness.

This project served as an excellent hands-on approach to mastering fundamental system design concepts in front-end development.
